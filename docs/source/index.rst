.. note::

   This project is under active development.

:math:`SL_{C0de}` is a python library based on the theory described in :cite:p:`dalca_2013`. This module provides tools to resolve the Sea Level Equation (SLE). This theory incorporates the governing equations, shoreline migration due to local sea level variation and changes in the geometry of grounded/marine based ice. This theory is based on Love numbers theory, which include gravitational, deformational and rotational effects of the sediment redistribution.
