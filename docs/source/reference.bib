  abstract = {We derive a generalized theory for gravitationally self-consistent, static sea level variations on earth models of arbitrary complexity that takes into account the redistribution of sediments. The theory is an extension of previous work that incorporated, into the governing equations, shoreline migration due to local sea level variations and changes in the geometry of grounded, marine-based ice. In addition, we use viscoelastic Love number theory to present a version of the new theory valid for spherically symmetric earth models. The Love number theory accounts for the gravitational, deformational and rotational effects of the sediment redistribution. As a first, illustrative application of the new theory, we compute the perturbation in sea level driven by an idealized pulse of sediment transport into the Gulf of Mexico. We demonstrate that incorporating a gravitationally self-consistent water load in this case significantly improves the accuracy of sea level predictions relative to previous simplified treatments of the sediment redistribution.},

  abstract = {Sea-level changes are of wide interest because they regulate coastal hazards, shape the sedimentary geologic record and are sensitive to climate change. In areas where rivers deliver sediment to marine deltas and fans, sea-level changes are strongly modulated by the deposition and compaction of marine sediment. Deposition affects sea level by increasing the elevation of the seafloor, by perturbing crustal elevation and gravity fields and by reducing the volume of seawater through the incorporation of water into sedimentary pore space. In a similar manner, compaction affects sea level by lowering the elevation of the seafloor and by purging water out of sediments and into the ocean. Here we incorporate the effects of sediment compaction into a gravitationally self-consistent global sea-level model by extending the approach of Dalca et al. (2013). We show that incorporating compaction requires accounting for two quantities that are not included in the Dalca et al. (2013) analysis: the mean porosity of the sediment and the degree of saturation in the sediment. We demonstrate the effects of compaction by modelling sea-level responses to two simplified 122-kyr sediment transfer scenarios for the Amazon River system, one including compaction and one neglecting compaction. These simulations show that the largest effect of compaction is on the thickness of the compacting sediment, an effect that is largest where deposition rates are fastest. Compaction can also produce minor sea-level changes in coastal regions by influencing shoreline migration and the location of seawater loading, which perturbs crustal elevations. By providing a tool for modelling gravitationally self-consistent sea-level responses to sediment compaction, this work offers an improved approach for interpreting the drivers of past sea-level changes.},

  abstract = {Theoretical approaches to computing gravitationally self-consistent sea-level changes in consequence of ice growth and ablation are comprised of two parts. The first is a mapping between variations in global sea level and changes in ocean height (required to define the surface load), and the second is a method for computing global sea-level change arising from an arbitrary surface loading. In Mitrovica \& Milne (2003) (Paper I) we described a new, generalized mapping between sea-level change and ocean height that takes exact account of the evolution of shorelines associated with both transgression and regression cycles and time-dependent marine-based ice margins. The theory is valid for any earth model. In this paper we extend our previous work in three ways. First, we derive an efficient, iterative numerical algorithm for solving the generalized sea-level equation. Secondly, we consider a special case of the new sea-level theory involving spherically symmetric earth models. Specifically, we combine our iterative numerical formulation with viscoelastic Love number theory to derive an extended pseudo-spectral algorithm for solving the new sea-level equation. This algorithm represents an extension of earlier methods developed for the fixed-shoreline case to precisely incorporate shoreline migration processes. Finally, using this special case, we quantitatively assess errors incurred in previous efforts to extend the traditional (fixed shoreline) sea-level equation of Farrell \& Clark (1976) to treat time-dependent shorelines. We find that the approximations adopted by Johnston (1993) and Milne (1998) to treat transgression and regression at shorelines introduce negligible ({$\sim$}1 per cent) error into predictions of post-glacial relative sea-level histories. In contrast, the errors associated with the Peltier (1994) sea-level equation are an order of magnitude larger, and comparable to the error incurred using the traditional sea-level theory. Furthermore, our numerical tests verify the high accuracy of the Milne (1998) approximation for treating the influence of grounded, marine-based ice.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY             The computation of the Love numbers (LNs) for a spherically symmetric self-gravitating viscoelastic Earth is a classical problem in global geodynamics. Here we revisit the problem of the numerical evaluation of loading and tidal LNs in the static limit for an incompressible planetary body, adopting a Laplace inversion scheme based upon the Post-Widder formula as an alternative to the traditional viscoelastic normal modes method. We also consider, within the same framework, complex-valued, frequency-dependent LNs that describe the response to a periodic forcing, which are paramount in the study of the tidal deformation of planets. Furthermore, we numerically obtain the time-derivatives of LNs, suitable for modelling geodetic signals in response to surface loads variations. A number of examples are shown, in which time and frequency-dependent LNs are evaluated for the Earth and planets adopting realistic rheological profiles. The numerical solution scheme is implemented in ALMA3 (the plAnetary Love nuMbers cAlculator, version 3), an upgraded open-source Fortran 90 program that computes the LNs for radially layered planetary bodies with a wide range of rheologies, including transient laws like Andrade or Burgers.},

  abstract = {We present a complete derivation of the equation governing long-term sea-level variations on a spherically symmetric, self-gravitating, Maxwell viscoelastic planet. This new `sea-level equation' extends earlier work by incorporating, in a gravitationally self-consistent manner, both a time-dependent ocean\^continent geometry and the in\textsterling uence of contemporaneous perturbations to the rotation vector of the planet. We also outline an e\textcurrency cient, pseudo-spectral, numerical methodology for the solution of this equation, and present a variety of predictions, based on a suite of earth models, of relative sea level (RSL) variations due to glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). These results show that the contribution to the predicted RSL signal from GIA-induced perturbations to the rotation vector can reach 7\^8 m over the postglacial period in geographic regions where the rotationally induced signal is a maximum. This result is sensitive to variations in the adopted lower-mantle viscosity and is relatively insensitive to variations in the adopted lithospheric thickness. We also show that the rotationally induced component of RSL change is su\textcurrency cient to in\textsterling uence previous estimates of Late Holocene melting events and ongoing sea-level change due to GIA which were based on a RSL theory for a non-rotating Earth. In particular, estimates of Antarctic melting over the last 5 kyr, based on the amplitude of sea-level highstands from the Australian region, may require an adjustment downwards of the order of 0.5 m of equivalent sea-level rise. Furthermore, present-day rates of sea-level change are perturbed by as much as *0.2 mm yr\{1 by the rotational component of sea-level change, and this has implications for GIA corrections of the global tide gauge record. Over the period from the last glacial maximum to the present, we predict a distinctly non-monotonic variation in the rotation-induced component of RSL. This is in agreement with our previous preliminary study (Milne \& Mitrovica 1996), but contrasts signi\textcent cantly with predictions presented by Han \& Wahr (1989) and Bills \& James (1996). We demonstrate that the disagreement arises as a consequence of approximations adopted in the latter studies. We furthermore refute an assertion by Bills \& James (1996) that previously published constraints on mantle viscosity and ice-sheet histories which did not incorporate a rotation-induced RSL component are `largely invalidated' by this omission.\vphantom\}},
